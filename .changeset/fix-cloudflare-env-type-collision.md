Fix Cloudflare Env type collision by adding worker-configuration.d.ts

Add worker-configuration.d.ts generated by Wrangler to fix type collision issues where the Env interface points to node_modules instead of project-specific Cloudflare.Env definitions. This ensures proper TypeScript declarations for the Cloudflare Workers environment and resolves compilation issues when extending YDurableObjects.

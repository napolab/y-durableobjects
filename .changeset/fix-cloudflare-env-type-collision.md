Fix Cloudflare Env type collision and improve TypeScript support

This patch resolves type collision issues and improves TypeScript support:

- **Fixed CI failures**: Removed unavailable @cloudflare/workers-types references from tsconfig.json that were causing TypeScript compilation errors
- **Adopted wrangler types**: Added worker-configuration.d.ts generated by `wrangler types` (introduced in Wrangler v3) for accurate type definitions
- **Resolved type collisions**: Eliminated conflicts where empty Cloudflare.Env from node_modules overwrote project-specific environment types
- **Enhanced documentation**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide for type collision issues

Users benefit automatically from improved type support without needing to modify their code. The `wrangler types` command is now the recommended approach for generating Cloudflare Workers TypeScript types.
